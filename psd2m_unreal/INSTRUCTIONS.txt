28 Oct 2024

Tested with Unreal version 5.4.4

Install instructions:
    -   Ensure you have supported Unreal version installed
        If you have a different version:
        From the Epic games launcher -> Library tab -> Yellow "+" button ->
        Click the dropdown arrow in the icon that appears -> Select desired version -> Click "Install" in the icon

    -   In windows file explorer, from the Unreal Engine install location, open the Unreal Root folder
        By default the full path will be: C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_[Unreal Version]

    -   Copy deployment to [Unreal Root]\Engine\Plugins\Editor\PSDtoUnreal

    -   Ensure the folder structure is correct
        You should have .dll files locayed in this path:
        [Unreal Root]\Engine\Plugins\Editor\PSDtoUnreal\Binaries\Win64

    - IMPORTANT: Ensure BuildId is correct
    ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- -----
    -   Find the correct BuildId number from another plugin, here
        [Unreal Root]\Engine\Plugins\Editor\PluginBrowser\Binaries\Win64\UnrealEditor.modules
    -   Open in notepad, and confirm the BuildId value ("23058290" for Unreal 5.1.0, "33043543" for Unreal 5.4.4)
    -   Ensure that PSDtoUnreal uses a matching BuildId number, here
        [Unreal Root]\Engine\Plugins\Editor\PSDtoUnreal\Binaries\Win64\UnrealEditor.modules
		
    -   Run the Unreal Engine, and open any existing project
    -   The PSDtoUnreal windows can be launched from the Window menu -> PSDtoUnreal




Build instructions:
    -   Requires Visual Studio 2022
    -   Open the "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt"
	
    -   To build and deploy only (no development)
	    -   Open script \psd2m_installer\build_deployment_unreal.bat in text editor
	    -   Set UNREAL_DIR to the Unreal install root directory (containing the \Engine folder)
		-   Run script from command line
		
		-   Deployment is in \Builds\installer\stage_full\unreal
	
    -   To build for development
	    -   Use scripts \psd2m_unreal\prepare_project.bat and \psd2m_unreal\prepare_solution.bat
	    -   Open prepare_solution.bat in text editor
		-   Set UNREAL_DIR to the Unreal install root directory (containing the \Engine folder)
	    -   Run prepare_project.bat first, then prepare_solution.bat
	    -   Open HostProject.sln in Visual Studio
		-   Right-click project "HostProject" -> Set as startup project, click F5 to launch Unreal
		
		-   Deployment is in \psd2m_unreal\Plugins\Editor\PSDtoUnreal
        -   Project uses read-only copies of header files from PSDto3D - do not modify
            Located under \psd2m_unreal\Plugins\Editor\PSDtoUnreal\Source\ThirdParty\PSDto3DLibrary\Public\PSDto3DLibrary
            Instead, modify original header files only, then use prepare_project.bat to re-copy
		
    -   Unreal working project is in \psd2m_unreal, and .gitignore ensures Unreal intermediate files are not checked in


Enjoy!
